       "In 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing integration with existing agents developed through various methods. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Utilizes LLMs and mathematical frameworks to design adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments. PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration, supporting scalable and ethical AI applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Google Antigravity**: An AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) that introduces an \"agent-first\" paradigm, allowing developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents. It features an agent sidebar and a control center for orchestrating multiple agents. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Antigravity?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: A protocol-driven multi-agent system designed for intelligent experience entities. It introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer and incorporates a layered memory system for structured knowledge retention and continual learning. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: A fully open-source, multi-module agent framework aimed at democratizing the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data and enhancing agent robustness and performance. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",

It enables automated workflows across multiple services and has gained rapid popularity. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Manus**: An autonomous AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect Pte Ltd, designed to independently carry out complex real-world tasks without direct or continuous human guidance. It is considered one of the world's first autonomous agents capable of independent thinking and dynamic planning. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_%28AI_agent%29?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard introduced by Anthropic to standardize the integration and sharing of data between AI systems and external tools. Adopted by major AI providers, including OpenAI and Google DeepMind, MCP provides a universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent 365**: Microsoft's tool designed to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and operate across different digital environments. It integrates with Microsoft 365 apps and is compatible with AI agents built through Microsoft's tools and open-source options. ([windowscentral.com](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-doubles-down-on-agentic-ai-agent-365-prepares-for-a-future-with-over-1-billion-agents?utm_source=openai))\n",
